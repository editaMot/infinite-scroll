# Nature Lovers

Welcome to Nature Lovers â€“ a web application designed to showcase an infinite scroll experience for nature enthusiasts.

## Features:

1. Infinite Scrolling: Users can continuously scroll through nature photos without needing to manually load more content. As the user scrolls down the page, new images automatically load and display, providing a seamless browsing experience.

2. Typescript
3. SCSS + CSS module for styling
4. Vitest for testing

## Getting Started

To get up and running with the Nature Lovers project, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nature-lovers.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd nature-lovers
npm install
```

### Configure Environment

The Nature Lovers project requires a Flickr API key to fetch and display photos. To configure your environment:

1. Obtain a Flickr API Key:
   - Go to the Flickr API page.
   - Sign in with your Flickr account or create a new one.
   - Follow the instructions to create a new API application and get your API key.
2. Create a .env File:
   - In the root of the project directory, create a .env file if it does not already exist.
   - Add the following line to the .env file, replacing YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY with the API key you obtained:

```bash
VITE_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY
```

### Start the Development Server

To start the development server and launch the application locally, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5173 to see the application in action.

### Build for Production

To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates optimized build files in the dist directory, ready for deployment.

### Running Tests

To run the tests and ensure the application is functioning correctly, execute:

```bash
npm test
```

### Viewing Test Results with Vitest UI

For a detailed view of test results and to interact with Vitest's test interface, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

This will start the Vitest UI, allowing you to see real-time updates and details about your test runs, making it easier to debug and analyze test results.
